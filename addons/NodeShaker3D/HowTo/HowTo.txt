## How to use the NodeShaker3D ##

1: Add the NodeShaker3D node to a 3D scene.
2: Set the target to a node that inherits from Node3D
3: Create a script and add an export variable that takes the NodeShaker3D as input
4: In the ready function call the NodeShaker3D method called induce_stress
the method induce_stress takes a float between 0.0 - 1.0, so the length of the shake can be different

NOTE:
	This was inspired by the unity tutorial camera shaker, I have converted it into godot
	and also added some extra features.
