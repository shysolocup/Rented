# Dev Logs

folders here log certain versions each containing usually 5 logs per folder until it goes onto the next one<br>
this is how they're split up:<br>

`versionindex_title_x.y_index`

ending up like this:<br>

`3_PreAlpha_2.0_1`

- version index is for organization it's just the order of the version title
- version title is the name of the version like PreAlpha, Alpha, Beta, and Release
- version is the standard version format of x.y as an overview of the version not including minor patches but only major versions and major patches
- index is the ordering of the folder with the 5 file thing

each of the 5 or so logs in each folder follow a similar naming scheme except it's just just like this:<br>

`title_x.y.z.md`

all of this is compiled into the [`.logref.md`](https://github.com/shysolocup/Rented/blob/master/.logref.md) file in order for more neatness
